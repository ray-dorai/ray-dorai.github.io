The H치vam치l is advice from the Icelandic codex, attributed to Odin as a "Song of the High One". 

In modern urban warfare, pie-ing involves sectioning off the dead (space unoccupied by objects or walls) space in every room and corridor to clear it of possible threats. The Norse had something similar, advising travelers to check every room thoroughly before they entered.

"At every door-way,  
ere one enters,  
one should spy round,  
one should pry round  
for uncertain is the witting  
that there be no foeman sitting,  
within, before one on the floor"

The Havamal suggest that gifting travelers is a norm to be followed, but it is nonetheless up to the traveler to be careful and canny about how his behavior. The traveler is a guest, and a guest is at the mercy of his host. Wit is praised as a virtue- wit will find you friends.  

The first step in an OODA loop is to observe, and the Edda is no different:  
"Let the wary stranger who seeks refreshment  
keep silent with sharpened hearing;  
with his ears let him listen, and look with his eyes;  
thus each wise man spies out the way."  

Self-reliance is praised- a man who wins status for himself is happy (or secure). A man who relies on others to win status for him is uneasy (or insecure). Intelligence/awareness (wit) is shown as an ally of the poor, and is suggested to provide more use than wealth itself. It is for this reason that alcohol is denigrated- a man who drinks has less of his wit.  

Stay with silence, until you have to speak the right word.  

Those who wander most (breadth of experience) can tell when someone is wise. Fools eat more than they can digest. Insomnia is a sign of a lack of wisdom, sleeping well is a sign of wisdom. Proper questions and answers are a mark of wisdom. When people are not proved (without skin in the game), they seem wise. A guest is only welcome for a time. Stay past that time and you will be unwelcome.  

Your own house is best, no matter how tiny. Be prepared to fight everywhere (see: self-reliance).  

Everyone likes gifts. Those who give and keep on giving have the longest relationships. If you don't trust someone, laugh with them, bring them cheer, but do not share your thoughts with them. "Man is the joy of man." Live free enough to keep giving abundantly, and don't feed your grief.  

Watch out if you find yourself becoming too wise. If you know too much of many things, you won't be happy. Humans are formed by talking to other humans, and they become opaque through isolation. Careful what you say in public. Everything dies but memory. Wealth or a woman's love multiplies stupidities.  

Silence is best.  

Praise things after you've experienced them, not before or during- praise a wife when she's dead, and a weapon after it's used in combat.  

"work a ship for its gliding, a shield for its shelter,  
a sword for its striking, a maid for her kiss;   

The speech of a maiden should no man trust  
nor the words which a woman says;  
for their hearts were shaped on a whirling wheel  
and falsehood fixed in their breasts."  

For a woman's love, use soft words and wealth. Don't blame anything on anyone you love. Love makes intelligent men stupid. Love is the worst sickness for the wise. Women are fickle, know the part you're playing when you try to wife one up. It is important to note that when Odin went after Billing's daughter, he failed to seduce her, while when he went after the mead of poetry, he seduced Gunloth. When his purpose was clear (and was not primarily seduction of a woman), he was successful. When he made his purpose a woman, he was not successful.


Don't show those you don't trust your pain. __Friendship is when you can share your whole mind with another__. No one is so good that they don't have things about them you dislike, and no one is so bad that they can't be useful to someone. Share your wealth, or people will want to destroy you.  

Odin hung on a tree for many nights- this strikes me as an example of a Dark Night of the Soul, or a desert period in mysticism.  

It is better to ask for too little than to offer to give too much.
