Curled here  
Like fetal death  
Right knuckles on my neck  
Left fist under my belly  
Crying inside  
Without crying outside  
There is no one else here  
There is no one else here  
There is no one else here  
There is no one here.  
Fear. Desire. Fear. Desire. Fear. Desire. Fear. Desire. Fear. Desire. Fear. Desire. Grief.  
  
Grief.  
  
How long must we grieve  
This burning heart  
So much touch lost  
It better be worth it  
It better be worth it  
It better be worth it  
  
No one touches you  
No one touches you  
Except  
to teach  
you Struggle.  
  
Heart, why do you pulse in pain  
  
You have been lying here  
long enough.  
  
Time for the sun.
