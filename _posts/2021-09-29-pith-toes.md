I saw a kick  
on video  
  on YouTube  
A Golden Kick  
  someone I've never met  
 may never meet  
 Yet something in his foot  
 something in the way he moved  
 the way he stood  
 Elongated  
 Bouncing out  
 Full of play  
 Something in his play  
 Tears rush out  
   my chest a ball  
   rooted in my gut  
   rooted in my groin  
   rooted in my feet  
   Sand so long ago  
   A hill of sand  
   A dead end  
   House with an owl  
   A cockatoo  
   And a brother long lost  
   a bed like a boat  
     but on land  
 My feet  
   once stretched up  
   to fly like that  
   Before  
Before they put  
casts on them  
So I would walk  
  like everyone else  
  So I wouldn't walk  
  Like me.
