I see your dance  
in the shiver of branches  
in the flecks of snow  
spattering me with life  

I hear your chuckle  
In eddies of wind   
That caress hard bark  
Guarding life underneath  

I taste your skin  
In the cold air  
That warms my heart  

I smell your sex  
In every abyss  
In every moment   
Between   
Where I am lost  
In something vast  
And awesome  
Where I cease to be  
And am a part  
Of everything around me  

I feel your mind  
In thoughts that have a grace  
That I never had (surely that wasn't from me)  
I feel your mind  
In the joy of a furry thing  
In the comfort of sisterhoods    
I feel your mind  
In the bridges I want to build  
In the civilization I will accept  
I feel your mind  
In the laughter you've allowed  
In the comfort you've nurtured  

I feel you  
In me  
I feel God  
Through Us
