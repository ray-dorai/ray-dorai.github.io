NEET stands for not in education, employment, or training. The use of the term was popularized in the 2000s to address the rising numbers of young people (mostly men) who were electing to stay with their parents, friends, or other family without going to school or work. Often, these young men engaged in gaming, watching anime, and niche hobbies- all characterized by being very online. That is, their home, their home culture, is the internet. In Asia, this was often characterized as Internet addiction.  

We do what we do partially because of where we get our validation and status from. These things help give us a feeling of inclusion- of being a part of something greater- of having a purpose or function that is bigger than ourselves. In the last century or so (or a little more than that really), we have increasingly received our purpose from careers, from the market, and from markers of being a good worker in a capitalist society. Where before you might have received your purpose by being a part of the family you were in, by being a part of the church that you were in, by worshipping the god you worshipped in the way that you worshipped, and being a part of the country that you lived in. The rise of the nation-state, after all, happened in the last five-hundred years. When all these functions sort of collapsed- I'm telling you that nationalism has effectively collapsed in the last twenty years. Though, this is the beginning and it is a silent and quiet collapse- silent and quiet in that if you look around you, there are still nation-states. And they still control things, or at least appear to. Anyway, after this change, people began to look for meaning not from their communities, not from their gods, but from their careers. From what kind of car they drove, from what kind of house they were in, from where they went on holiday, from when their companies allowed them to go on holiday. So this is where most people get their sense of purpose. NEETs present us with a different way. The rise of the Internet allowed many people, including myself, to find a world with completely different status systems or seemingly completely different status systems. You may not be, in your everyday life, a respectable member of society by having no job, but you probably have a job in the games you play or in the gaming clans that you are a part of, or the niche nerd community that you might be a part of- all online.  

You could be a well-known artist on some forum. A well-known leader in another game. And all these things would serve to give some meaning to your life that you would not be getting from the people around you. Your everyday life as a NEET, if you are a NEET, is one of living in a desert. You have resources, that is, true physical resources, but your status- your social resources- are scarce. And those from outside of the desert do not know how you find water and food in this place. They do not know how you find your status, they do not know how you find your meaning. But the very fact that you have not committed suicide yet is proof that you are getting something somewhere. And this produces a lot of confusion for people who aren't NEETs. In what world would someone willingly choose to go jobless or without school, when everyone else around them says that is the only way to live? And there is no world where this exists. If NEETs were transported back into another time and another place, say the 18th century, they would not necessarily be NEETs because they would be surrounded by people who would not give them the mental space to even imagine a world where they did not devote their lives to their families and to their religions, or to money. NEETs got their sense of meaning, their sense of purpose from worlds that were created online. And I don't just mean this in terms of video games, but also in online communities. Community-driven purpose has always been impactful.   

If you read accounts of famous dead generals and philosophers, you will see a similar pattern, where there are cohorts of people that formed together that then go on to change the world. Where this happens is different at different times. If you go far back enough, a lot of these are groups of young men who were warriors formed by conflict in-between territories. At a later time, it might be a specific philosophy school. At another, it might be a specific front on a specific war. Later on, much later, in the modern era, we have salons and coffeehouses, companies such as Bell Labs, now, the venture capitalist firm, Y Combinator. But you also started to see this on the internet. Groups of people from various areas on the internet, staying together past whatever purpose they might have gathered for. I, for example, have a group of people that I stay in contact with who came together as a gaming clan. And a lot of us now don't really game that much. But we stay in touch. And there are exchanges made. There are social networks that are deepened because of these relationships. And in the long term wealth is about the wealth of your social network. So you have these communities with their alternate status systems. Instead of a career or what kind of car you drive, you might get status for how fast it might take you to figure out someone's real name.
You might get status for having played a specific game and been engaged in a sort of political process within that game some years ago. You might get status for thinking a certain way. In fact, this is probably how you often get status in communities like this, online. It's not how you look physically necessarily, though, these things tend to collapse over time. Or how you do in terms of the modern monetary system or anything like that, it's, it's how you think, because that is what comes out in text over time. And that is what comes out in your behavior over time. Even if no one has your real name, or your face attached to your behavior, they will learn your behavior well enough that many people can spot their friends online in totally different contexts. Just from the way they speak, in sentences.   

So let's talk about Ibn Khaldun, the writer of _The Muqaddimah_, a father of historiography and economics. He wrote about the Berbers and Arabs of the desert. He called them savages, and he wrote about the interplay between these people, and the people of the caliphate (Muslim empires, essentially) that he was a part of. And he noticed that there was a pattern. One, that the people who lived out there in the desert tended to be able to deal with hardship much more easily. Two, they were not very amenable to learning how to read or write, or anything like that. And this was actually an advantage to them. Because when the state wanted to domesticate an area, when it wanted to tax an area, when it wanted to control an area- it benefited from people who could read and write, because one of the ways that you take over is by changing the way people think. And three, these desert peoples often produced many noble houses. The first in the line of the noble house would often come from the desert- would be a desert savage. And this made for a strong founder. Because they were used to the hardship, they used their resources well to establish a strong organization. Now, the second generation builds on this and becomes a stronger house often. But Ibn Khaldun noticed that by the fourth generation or so there was a sort of decadence that happened, where the descendants would lose their strength, they would come to rely on all the material wealth that their ancestors made and left them. And they would forget the desert ways. And because they forgot their desert ways, they would forget how to be strong, and instead would favor markers of status and class in such a way that was disconnected from the ultimate source of that status, which was competence in surviving in a harsh environment.   

This pattern is not just in the Arabs- Peter Turchin, the historian and statistician who came up with a way of looking at history with data also points to a similar cycle. In a lot of steppe cultures, the steppe culture would conquer a sedentary agricultural populace. And once that happens, the thing that made it easy for those steppe cultures to conquer- the thing that made it easy for the Tartars, the Turks, or the Mongols to conquer the people that they conquered, was that hardship, that scarcity that they dealt with- and learning to live with that scarcity. But once they conquered a people, they would often take on the ways and the culture of the people they conquered. And this would essentially weaken them over time, even as they got richer.  

 In the mid-twentieth century, the science-fiction writer Frank Herbert released _Dune_: the first in a series of novels that has kind of paralleled the popularity of _The Lord of the Rings_ or _The Chronicles of Narnia_ in some ways, except in the area of science-fiction. Though it never got quite as strong a following as either of those, it does have a very strong following, especially for the first few books. And it's been witnessing a sort of resurgence in some circles. And I think that's actually because Frank Herbert includes a lot of these patterns that we see in the real world in his writing- to include the pattern of noble houses and desert peoples. You see, _Dune_ is set on the planet Arrakis. And this planet Arrakis is a desert planet. You may recognize it as the inspiration for Tatooine in _Star Wars_. There is an intergalactic Empire, a spacefaring Empire, that mines something called the Spice on Arrakis. And this spice is a substance that deeply changes the people who imbibe it. There are pilots, a group or a guild of pilots, that do all the flying in space for this empire. And the only way they can fly is with the help of this spice because it changes something about the way they think. Something about the way they perceive time. And so within the Byzantine politics of this empire, a noble family is sent to Dune to govern it. This the Atreides family. They come from a lush forest paradise of a planet. And so it's a very stark change for the family. Well, Leto Atreides, the Duke, the would-be governor of Arrakis, is something of a typical noble heroic leader. His wife, Lady Jessica, turns out to be a part of the Bene Gesserit and in this universe the Bene Gesserit are a secret, semi-religious order. They manipulate many things that happen in the galaxy. They're all extremely well-trained in various forms of manipulation, as well as ways of seeing the world. And among the things they do is that they plant stories in various cultures, stories that they can then take and use later. And this is going to become important in Dune, because they plant a story of a messiah among the Fremen.  

The Fremen in Dune, in Arrakis, are the local people of the desert. And they share a lot in common with the Berber, Bedouin or desert savages in Ibn Khaldun’s history. Except of course, it's science fiction and it’s space. So they're dealing with these special suits that allow them to recycle all the water that they use. And they use other space things. Kind of like what you would see in Star Wars or Star Trek and so on. But the point is that these people of this desert planet are people that the Space-Empire does not really understand. They don't really know how many of them there are, they don't really know much about their culture. They just govern over them. And these people kind of just tell the Empire what it wants to hear, but doesn't really share much of itself with the Empire, or all the knowledge that it knows. Because the bureaucrats who are sent by the Empire kind of have their story of how the world is and that's what they're looking for. The Fremen, meanwhile, know that to give an empire too much information is to let it have control over you. So they just show them what they want to see. This again is so similar to the history of central powers gaining influence in the Middle East and North Africa. So in the story of _Dune_, Leto Atreides, archetypical noble leader, is betrayed. Much like in _Game of Thrones_, by jealous power hungry other houses. In this case it's the Harkonnens, which is a house that has a culture of extreme greed and jealousy and clutching to own things. Whereas Atreides, as a leader, knows that you have to care for the people that you lead in order for them to serve you well, the Harkonnens lead by fear. But they are well -oised to take over the planet through their machinations, which they do. And in the process, they kill the Duke. But the Duke has a son, Paul Atreides. And of course, he has his wife, who is the Lady Jessica, the Bene Gesserit, the secret order of nuns- space-nuns who are manipulating the world around them. So imagine if the Jesuits were women, but also the CIA. So you have the situation. And the teenage son and his mother run into the desert. And there they meet the Fremen, the desert peoples. And they realize that because of the harsh environment, these Fremen, all of them, kind of act like a military unit. Which is to say, they have a lot of trust amongst themselves. And they mov ein a way that would make sense if you are moving as a military unit- quietly, well-machined, well-oiled. And Paul undergoes a ritual to take the spice in a certain way, and also to undergo great pain. Now, this is a ritual that among the Bene Gesserit, it is only women who tend to pass through unscathed. Men typically can't take it. If they do, they tend to go mad. But Paul goes through this ritual and he survives. And he does not seem to go mad as such, though, he's definitely changed. And his mother insinuates that he is the Fremen Messiah. And remember that the Bene Gesserit plant these mythologies all over the place. So Paul takes on this role as a sort of Messiah of the Fremen, of these people of the desert. And because they are used to scarcity,  because they're used to following a completely different value system and status system than the Empire, they win. And Paul takes over Arrakis. Eventually, he becomes the Emperor and his son will turn into something else. But that's another story.  

 The point is, NEEts are our Fremen. NEETs live in a sort of status desert. They are used to getting meaning and purpose from very unusual places, from places that others don't know how to get them. You know, for a lot of people, if you don't have a career, if you don't have a house, you are lost. The NEETs in your life, if you look around, you might notice, have found ways to survive without using a career as a symbol, without needing the same accolades or certifications in order to go on with their lives. And at the moment, they are constantly insulted for this. And a lot of them believe these insults- that they do indeed need careers and whatnot, but they keep on doing Something Else- either due to ‘stupidity’ or ‘laziness’, whatever explanation they may have. However, the fact is, they have found another way to survive. And this is incredibly valuable. Because if you have a system where everyone has the same incentives, then when it has weaknesses, it's hard for anyone to come out of these weaknesses. As a good example, most people work the forty-hour work week, even though it makes no sense as far as what we know about how learning works, and what we know about how ‘work’ works. If you're in an intellectual job, for instance, you can probably only get at most, oh, four hours- four good hours a day. And a lot of times, it's not about the same hours every day, it's, you might go hard for two weeks, and then kind of lay low for another three weeks or a month or whatever, and then have another cycle where you go hard for another two weeks. And that's much closer to how you might have lived as a forager, how your distant ancestors might have lived as foragers. You're not constantly working at a set time. That is from farming. And farming is relatively new. So in order to escape that, in order to be allowed to think for yourself, you need to find a way outside of that incentive system. Because famously, if you are paid not to believe in something, you will not be able to believe in it. If you are paid to believe in something, you will have no choice but to believe it. If you're a lawyer, you're going to need to believe, on some level, in the supremacy of the law. If you’re a soldier, you’re going to need to believe in the supremacy of your side. If you’re a teacher, you’re going to need to believe in the importance of the education system in learning. It's very hard to do to do otherwise. If you are being paid to give up ownership of the things you create, and of your time, and of your thoughts, then you will not be able to see that it is possible to live in another way. You will think that you must go, you know tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt in order to live in the world, when in actuality, you could have probably done just fine living on very little.   

And so this is how you might have a culture of people who have a lot of material wealth, but they are thinking like a peasant or serf class, a class that does not have ownership over their own minds. See in the past, it was land. You might have worked land that belonged to someone else. And because of that, everything you did, eventually added up to someone else's shit. Which is fine, as long as whoever's leading you cares about you, in the same way that Leto Atreides, the Duke in _Dune_, cares for his people. But that's actually very hard to do, it's very hard to provide that kind of leadership. And we lack that kind of leadership. Which means that most of the time, when you work for someone else, when you work the land for someone else, they're not going to use the fruits of your labor as well as you would if that was your own land. So similarly, what we are paid for now is to work our minds for someone else. And because of that, we aren't allowed to use the full extent of our minds, because it belongs to someone else. Your time belongs to someone else, your thoughts belong to someone else.   

Now, what NEETs have found is how to avoid that. How to live for themselves. Now, they are attacked for this every day. They are shamed for this every day. In the same way that in the story, in _Dune_, the Fremen are thought of as backwards people who scurry around in the desert, we think of NEEts as a backward people who scurry around in dark basements playing video games, when in fact, again, video games teach you how to fight. Most people don't realize this, except when they are having moral panics- talking about how video games lead to school shootings or crimes. But video games teach general intelligence. They give you an environment with certain constraints. And unlike school, there's not just one way to do things. Typically, there are many ways to do things. This teaches general intelligence through adversarial learning. When you are in a conflict with someone else, when you are in a player versus player game with someone else, you are learning how to fight. Now, people don't realize this, because we don't have many places left where we are allowed to fight in the way that two puppies might fight. You know, you see puppies, they're always kind of fighting, they’re play-fighting. In the same way, many games are play-fighting. But you don't realize this, because you're doing it in a non-embodied way. So it's being simulated on your mind, you're seeing it on a screen. And you think that Oh, it's stupid to think that this would have anything to do with anything outside of the game. But I can tell you that the lessons that you learn in such a game will transfer just fine, to grappling, to combat sports, to small-unit tactics. And that you can use all the same things to win at life. So we're sitting on this goldmine, in the same way that Arrakis was sitting on a goldmine of Fremen, in this case, a spicemine of Fremen. The ultimate value of Arrakis wasn't really in the spice, though the spice was a key part of it. It was in the people. In the Fremen, the desert peoples. So NEETs are our fremen because we are sitting on this vast, unused general intelligence. And just like the Bene Gesserit planted prophecies that could be used, we have prophecies planted in our NEETs. And we call these prophecies Dragonball Z. We call these prophecies The Avengers. We call these prophecies Pokemon. We call these prophecies Mass Effect. All these narratives are just lying there, waiting to be used. Because every NEET is walking around with these stories in their head. And if you provide them with actions, with choices in real life that mimic the stories, that allow them to perform these stories, then you are going to bring NEETs out into the rest of the world and the rest of the world will not know what hit them.
