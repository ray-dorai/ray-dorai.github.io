You are dealing with an information overload. That's why you're trying to reduce the amount of information that's coming in. There's something backed up in your processing, because the metaprocessing you are using is not adequate to deal with the amount of information you're receiving.  
Anxiety tells you that there's too much information to deal with.  
Panic is when the process stalls after all that information has come in anyway.  
These are alarms, telling you that the current database system ain't cutting it.  
The pain, the suffering- this will lead you to the contradictions that are part of what is creating the overload. If you unravel those, you'll probably come up with new database systems to deal with the amount of information you're stuck with.
