Did a bird smash into a window?
I did it
Did a car crash into a boy?
I did it
Did men rape her?
I did it
Did you starve?
I did it
Did cancer stiffen her walk?
I did it
Did the trees shrivel?
I did it
Did the drought take their tongues?
I did it
Did the dog eat chocolate?
I did it
Did an explosion tear them apart?
I did it
Did he break his body?
I did it
Did they break his bones?
I did it
Did the drunk paralyze her?
I did it
Did you get ridiculed?
I did it
Did you lose?
I did it
Did he choke to death on his own phlegm?
I did it
Did a thousand living creatures wail in suffering?
I did it
