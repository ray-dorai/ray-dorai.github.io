Suck me into  
that custard sweetness  

I lit myself  
on your Flame  
(moth that I am)  
Burned  
Charred  
Ash scattered   
In sacrifice  

Go ahead  
cross your legs  
ban me from your temple  
if you must  
I scatter in the winds  
ash that I am  

To reach the sky  
(where parts of you hide)  
I burned  
So I could ride  
the winds of love  
to find you  
everywhere  
--everywhere, everything  
this is your true temple  

We are apart  
So that we remember  
We are never apart
