There is blood   
on all our hands,  
but you   
you will not admit this,  
so for those of us   
who will,  
who sing this song,  
this most silent song,  
alone in a clearing,  
among the trees,  
we take your blood,   
there is blood on our hands,  
and we wear it as raiment,   
we wear it as wings,   
we wear it as all the proof we need.  

For those of us  
who Listen.
