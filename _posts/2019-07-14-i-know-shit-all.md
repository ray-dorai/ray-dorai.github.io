I don't know logic  
But I know truth  
I don't know algebra  
But I can draw a line  
I don't know calculus  
But I know how to drive  
I don't know probability  
But I know how to gamble  
I don't know graph theory  
But I know who you offended last week  
I don't know knot theory  
But I can tie my shoelaces  
I don't know category theory  
But I know that a book is sometimes something you read and sometimes a doorstep
