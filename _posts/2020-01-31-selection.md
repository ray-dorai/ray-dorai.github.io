How did we  
Come to dissect  
Everything  
(including ourselves)  
And forget   
that the dead  
are easier  
to dissect  

How did we  
Come to dissect  
Everything  

And in surprise  
Find ourselves  
Undead--  
Shambling   
in tearing cycles  
of sudden death  
and bloody birth  

I am grateful  
For your doubt  
Your doubts, they force my faith  

I am grateful   
For your distaste  
Your distastes, they force my tasting  

I am grateful  
For your escapes  
Your escapes, they cut mine off  

I am grateful  
For your walls  
Your walls, they sap my walls  

I am grateful  
For your control  
Your control, it demands my surrender  

I am grateful  
For the agony of your beauty  
Your tormenting beauty, it reveals my endless beauty  

I am grateful   
I was not chosen  
Your disinterests, they make me the Chooser  

And Choosers, love,  
Choosers like you and me  
we are closer  
to The One that chooses  

like Her  
We build this world  
One trapped choice  
At a time
