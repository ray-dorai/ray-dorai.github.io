**Observe** the **Cue** that starts the habit. This is the trigger that sets of the process of your behavior.
_When I go into the office in the morning..._  


**Orient** toward the **Craving**. Notice if you are attracted or repelled by it. 
_I notice I crave a Mocha Monster energy drink. I am attracted to it because caffeine is 'good' at work._  

**Decide** if you want the habit (does it fit with your strategic direction?). If you want it, make it attractive. If you don't want it, make it unattractive.  
_I decide I don't want the energy drink, so I'm going to see how it doesn't fit with my strategic direction. I need all my resources for my path, and the extra spent on an energy drink could be used elsewhere. In addition, I could use a low caffeine tolerance for moments when I might actually need the boost for my path._  

**Act** on the habit and reinforce it with a reward if it's the habit you want.  
_I drink water._
