We were given the throne of Heaven, but heavy is the crown  

you can care about the world, and devote your life to it through something like EA, but the humans that you sacrifice to it will not love you in as meaningful a way as we can. What use is sacrificing to gods who do not give you rain? Why stay with a partner whose taking does not enrich you?
