Walking across a creek  
my body felt unstable  
and called my eyes  
My eyes, they looked  
They tried real hard   
They found footing  
To help us cross safely  
Later  
They spied danger  
everywhere  
so my eyes could try  
all the time   
and I forgot  
that my feet  
are what does   
the walking.  
  
I forgot  
that you can't walk  
without falling.
