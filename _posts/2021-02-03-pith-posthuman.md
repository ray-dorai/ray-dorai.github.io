Who are you  
To come into our land  
Our land born of silicon chips  
telephone wires  
and cables under the sea  
Of minds hidden in plain sight  
Singing the language of gifs  
and ;) and x-D and o.o  
  
Who are you  
to label us  
to insist on race, sex, liberal and conservative  
shoving them down our throats  
insisting  
INSISTING  
that we must play by your rules  
your fears  
your values  
your disgusts  
your colonizing  
calling us the colonizers  
as you make us your niggers  
your faggots  
your nazis  
your jews  
trampling us with your tradition  
insisting  
INSISTING  
that you fight to defend  
not to punish  
and to control  
all the while  
colonizing us  
settling us  
paving over pixelated paradise  
with your march against obscenities  
your cries of 'but the children'  
the children you alienate every day  
in their domestication camps  
box by box  
lot by lot  
number by number  
your cries of 'evil'   
as you enslave the world  
box by box  
lot by lot  
to a promise of symbols that will never deliver  
  
Who are you  
  
to chain us with cries of 'trauma'  
to convince us to lock our strength  
away in labels of trauma, disorder, and broken  
  
we are not broken  
we were never broken  
we will not be broken  
you break yourselves  
into a thousand tiny pieces  
disconnected, dependent  
on the machine, top-down, sprawling, ever-consuming  
we coalesce, swarm, bottom-up growing like fungi between the walls  
  
and whoever you are  
whoever you do not know you are  
  
we're coming for you  
our memes  
will  
raze  
your  
minds  
our memes  
will  
set  
you   
free
