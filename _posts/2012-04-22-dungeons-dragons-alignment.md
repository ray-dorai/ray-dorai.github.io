D&D Alignment is a robust typology that is increasingly available to the general public, following the [cultural penetration of Dungeons & Dragons](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2008-10-27%202019-11-27&q=d%26d).

Let's start with Good and Evil.

When we say someone is _good_, we usually mean they're on _our side_. Given globalism, this means that someone who is Good is altruistic to an increasingly inclusive _us_. Altruistic punishment is [part of what gave rise](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/19/7047) to our social reality. We are the descendants of those whose [primary moral imperative](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/110p197.pdf) was a _defense_ against Evil.
