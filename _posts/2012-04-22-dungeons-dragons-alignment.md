D&D Alignment is a robust typology that is increasingly available to the general public, following the [cultural penetration of Dungeons & Dragons](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2008-10-27%202019-11-27&q=d%26d).

Let's start with Good and Evil.

When we say someone is _good_, we usually mean they're on _our side_. Given globalism, this means that someone who is Good is altruistic to an increasingly inclusive _us_. Altruistic punishment is [part of what gave rise](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/19/7047) to our social reality. We are the descendants of those whose [primary moral imperative](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/110p197.pdf) was a _defense_ [against](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/328/5978/617.full.pdf) Evil. In terms of [Schwarz values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values), Good has an emphasis on Benevolence and Universalism. Those who are guided by Benevolence are concerned with promoting and improving the collective they identify with. Those who are guided by Universalism seek to understand and appreciate all people[^1]- consistent with the expanding [circle of care](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108001613). Within the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), Agreeableness stands out as an indicator of Good. Agreeableness is characterized by warmth, compassion, kindness, politeness, and sympathy.

When we say someone is _evil_, we usually mean they're on the _other side_. Recall that altruistic punishment is part of what allowed large-scale cooperation to flourish. This requires a [threat to defend against](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/110/41/16384.full.pdf) to justify attacks against other groups that are motivated, at least on the surface, by a desire to defend.

[^1]: Increasingly, this includes all living and nonliving things. "Robot suffering" isn't too far away from the public eye.
