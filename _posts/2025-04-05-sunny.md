Spring came early  
Or so I hoped  
I fooled myself with the green   
And a day or three of warm sun  
I ignored the almanac  
Maybe they'll make it  
Planted the potatoes and onions  
Then snow came again   
with frost to bite.  
  
The child we were expecting  
became still  
We had a name, early this time  
Sunita, if a girl  
Sunny   
Oh Sunny  
we made for you a crevice  
old womb  
in the richest soil we have  
Not rich as the land   
  of your parents'  
    childhoods  
But as rich as we have  
Where prairie and mountain meet  
We will plant  
chokecherry here  
Where you have returned  
to Our Mother
