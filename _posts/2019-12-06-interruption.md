Missing you is sharp
in my serratus anterior
it feels tight and reaching somewhere around my kidneys
loose and open with pain
 above my bladder
and everywhere below the diaphragm,
there is a hot medial line... 
something that I would've once called weakness
something is
Not Right and Very Wrong
like a plant that was cut,
reaching out to send water and minerals
to a part that isn't there
perhaps this is what propagation is
I reach out for you, feel that you've been cut away
So I grow the you in me
And all growth
needs pain
to force attention
to remember the structures of you
so I can build them anew
in me
