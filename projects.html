<h1>Current Projects:</h1>
	        <p><a href="https://www.agitproper.org/">Agitproper</a>, propaganda strategization for anyone.</p>
	        <p><a href="https://foretrek.com/">Foretrek</a>, uniting teams.</p>
		<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/walkswithray">Walks with Ray</a>, a podcast showcasing how thoughts arise from walking.</p>
	        <p>A <b>Submission Grappling</b> class at the local recreation center to test a curriculum using the ecological approach and to build a jumping off point toward the Live-Action Battle Arena.</p>

<h1>Shelved Projects:</h1>
	        <p><a href="https://ray-dorai.github.io/armyourmind/">Arm Your Mind</a>, combat tactics for people with little interest in combat tactics. I started this in response to the panic of 2020, it does not seem to have much of a need now. Though, I may go back and start filling things in later.</p>
		<p><b>Circle of Kings</b>, a low fantasy fiction inspired by Southern India and South-East Asia. I hatched this when I was in India, and without interacting with at least one Indian every day, it's hard to stay in the mindspace required for this story. </p>
	        <p><b>Nth Culture Kid</b>, an autobiography. I expect this to flow out if we're expecting a child. Otherwise, it does not seem to have a reason to come out.</p>
                <p><b>Abode of the Yielding Way</b>, a combat playground and civilizational seed. Needs building blocks. Which means a minimum viable Live-Action Battle Arena and some land.</p>

<h1>Dropped Projects:</h1>
	        <p><b><a href="https://hitw.neocities.org/">Hollow is The World</a></b>, a stabby hard fantasy serial featuring <a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a> to memorize a little of what the characters learn. It was self-indulgent.
	        <p><a href="https://raydoraisamy.bandcamp.com/album/if-you-ask-its-free">If you ask, it's free</a>, an album. It was an experiment, now learned from and done.</p>
                <p><b>The Niobrara Project</b>: 'Deep Springs College on the frontier for adults' is still something of a dream, but perhaps we'll end up with less of a college and more of the civilizational seed, at a smaller scale.

<h1>Upcoming Projects:</h1>
	       <p><b>Life Kills: A Southeast Asian Perspective</b>. An audio series looking at fights to see how people learn to live together. This will be a polished, edited podcast to contrast against 'Walks with Ray'.
