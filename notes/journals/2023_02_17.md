- For stand-up [[grappling]], it would be useful to have [[throws]] in every [[diagonal]] [[direction]].
- The point of [[Judo]] is to throw the other person so that their back is flat against the ground. This would give a Judoka some time to act against a person on the ground, since movement with your back against the ground is more difficult than [[movement]] with your belly down, where you can use all your limbs- this is why the [[hip]] heist is about facing the ground with your [[hips]].
