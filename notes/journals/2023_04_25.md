- [[People]] are usually [[right]] about something being [[wrong]] for them, but usually wrong about [[why]] it's wrong for them.
- Stuff that will [[sell]] over a long [[time]] is competing with the [[best]] there's ever been.
- For any [[business]] [[product]] or [[service]], check:
	- [[Who]] is this for? Who isn't it for?
	- What does it do for them that nothing else has?
	- [[Why]] should they [[care]] about what it will do for them?
