- When people [[talk]] about [[change]], some things said point toward change, while other things said point against change.
  collapsed:: true
	- When changing, people [[talk]] about the following things:
	  collapsed:: true
		- How things as they are don't work for them.
		- How changing things may work for them.
		- Talking about a [[want]] to [[change]].
		- [[Moving]] like they think [[change]] is something they can do.
	- When pushing back [[against]] [[change]], people [[talk]] about the following things:
	  collapsed:: true
		- How things as they are work for everyone.
		- How things wouldn't work if they changed.
		- Talking about wanting things to stay the same.
		- [[Freezing]] and stuttering like they don't think [[change]] is possible.
- Something that fits with a [[goal]] is often much harder to [[see]] than when it really doesn't [[fit]]. What's right is more [[invisible]], what's wrong is relatively easy to spot. In light of this, it makes sense that [[teaching]] at [[scale]] will focus on avoiding what's [[wrong]] instead of learning how to look for what's right.
