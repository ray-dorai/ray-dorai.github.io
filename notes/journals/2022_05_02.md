- An [[alternator]] can be used to turn [[rotation]] into [[electricity]].  A [[lead]] [[acid]] [[battery]] with thicker plates and [[separators]] is a deep [[cycle]] battery- designed to be fully [[discharged]] and [[recharged]] without deteriorating. Lithium batteries are also a sort of deep cycle battery, but lead acid deep cycle batteries are 12v and available in larger sizes. An [[inverter]] will convert direct [[current]] to 120v alternating current.
