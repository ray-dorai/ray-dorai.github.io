- A [[computer]] is a sort of [[clock]] that can add, check, and subtract numbers based on the [[time]]. A computer is many [[slaves]], constantly waiting for a [[signal]] to [[move]]. Lots and lots of detailed work is hidden, and so looks like [[magic]]. [[Programming]] [[language]] is something used to collect and organize different standardized ways to complete and balance numbers. Each of these standardized ways solves a particular mathematical obstacle that is put in front of someone. A lot of understanding computers is about understanding how [[fast]] it will take a computer to go through some standardized way of completing and balancing numbers.
- A [[problem]] is a [[block]] that is put in front of someone. Like any block, you could [[use]] what is there, you could go through it, you could [[destroy]] it, you could [[move]] it, but the simplest method is often to move around it.
