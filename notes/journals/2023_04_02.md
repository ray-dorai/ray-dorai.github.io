- When learning a physical [[skill]], it is best to [[focus]] [[attention]] to a [[goal]] [[outside]] of the [[body]].
	- When a [[coach]] tells you what to do based on something [[inside]] the [[body]], see how it can be said based on something [[outside]] the body.
	- When we tell someone to [[act]] in a certain way, what is the [[distance]] or [[direction]] that we are including in the statement?
		- Cues that focus on changing something [[near]] the [[body]] work more when the [[skill]] is new. Cues that [[focus]] on [[changing]] something far from the body work more when the [[player]] is an [[expert]].
		- Different cues will work better for different people. [[Change]] your cues based on the person.
			- To [[find]] what [[cues]] will work on someone, get someone to [[move]] with a [[constraint]] and then ask them to [[talk]] about how they moved.
				- Use the player's own words to make the [[cue]].
					- Focusing on the holistic vibe of the [[movement]] improved lap [[times]] for simracers.
- [[Optimal Character Recognition]] converts [[image]] files to [[text]] files.
