- [[Attack]] when [[position]] is [[strong]], [[defend]] when [[weak]].
- Everything in the [[body]] changes to flow with what the [[environment]] asks of it.
	- So, if a body is given heavier [[weight]] to carry, then it will [[change]] to be able to [[lift]] that weight.
	- The [[body]] drifts toward the lowest state of [[energy]].
	- If a [[body]] has changed to [[fit]] with a [[misalignment]], then switching to an aligned position will feel uncomfortable.
	- Lower [[back]] [[pain]] is associated with a lack of muscular [[strength]] and [[endurance]] in the hips and back.
	- [[Pain]] does not necessarily indicate [[damage]], though it may help to prevent it.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Expectations around pain change the way pain is adapted to, and how long and where it lasts.
		- Localized [[pain]] is relieved by increasing [[strength]] in that area.
		- [[Tightness]] is often caused by [[pain]], [[instability]], or [[weakness]].

			- [[Kettlebell]] swings at high volume build [[endurance]] in the muscles that stabilize the [[spine]]. So do reverse hyperextensions.
	- [[Tight]] muscles can be [[weak]] and [[loose]] muscles can be [[strong]].
