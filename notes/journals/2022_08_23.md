- [[Separatists]] (counter-[[elites]]) pay a lot of attention to check points, frontiers, and other [[spaces]] in-[[between]]. Occupying a [[checkpoint]] allows for the monitoring of what goes in and out, and also gives control over what goes in and out.
	- [[Weak]] [[states]] emphasize [[border]] presence to signal their existence.
		- Separatists and weak states often agree to have a [[checkpoint]] that is not fully controlled by either because each lacks [[power]] to take full [[control]].
