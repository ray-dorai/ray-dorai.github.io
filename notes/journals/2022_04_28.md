- Small [[unit]] [[principles]]:
	- Modern [[special forces]] rely on an initial [[surprise]] to seize the [[initiative]]. [[Delaying]] actions are not in their favor. Slowing them down saps their [[momentum]]. [[Awareness]] leeches their potential for surprise.
	- The bigger the unit, the more [[friction]] [[scales]].
	- If the expected [[movement]] is not [[simple]], it is difficult to [[hide]] and even harder to setup a [[feedback]] [[loop]] for that particular target.
	- Requiring lots of [[control]] makes [[preparation]] difficult.
	- [[Simplicity]] happens by limiting [[goals]], using as much of what is available as possible, and having [[awareness]] of the enemy. Awareness makes it easier to lower the number of goals to only what is needed to finish the mission. [[Timing]] is what must be [[hidden]] for an attack.
	- Hiding your next [[move]] is most useful as a delaying effort.
	- The enemy is usually [[prepared]], but when are they least prepared?
		- The enemy is often least prepared in [[transition]].
	- For a [[raid]], [[speed]] is less [[relative]] because [[resistance]] is a given, since raids are necessarily an [[attack]] on a [[position]] where [[defense]] is [[prepared]]. Due to this, [[time]] works in favor of the defenders, and not the raiders. So raiders need to move with as much [[speed]] as possible.
