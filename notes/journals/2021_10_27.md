- You cannot contain yourself, so you are in [[expansion]].
- [[Expansion]] comes from being able to laugh at the illusion of difference, of being light with things, and overcoming [[fear]] enough to celebrate everything.
- If something shown about [[living]] makes sense, it will make [[sense]] on every level. It will [[scale]].
- When apathetic, let yourself be spacious. When fixated and angry, let yourself be clear and precise. When obese and vain, let yourself expand with balance. When desiring to own, let yourself see the details. When envious, comparing, and jealous, let your actions be fulfilled.
