- By putting your hands on the same place of a [[steering]] wheel or [[joystick]] of a [[vehicle]], it is easier to estimate how far you've moved it.
	- For whatever [[controls]] you have, it is fitting to be able to move it without [[moving]] the positions of your [[hands]] or whatever is manipulating the controls.
	- When [[driving]], how can you [[turn]] a corner while turning the steering wheel as little as possible?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Every time the wheel is turning at a hard angle, the [[tires]] are also turning, in a way that is creating more [[friction]] between the tires and the [[road]]. This slows you down. You lose [[speed]].
	- How can you be [[aware]] of what's all around you? One way is by using mirrors.
	- [[Engines]] are to [[speed]] you up, not [[slow]] you down.
		- So [[brake]], then downshift to take corners faster.
