					- The rules they use to make [[decisions]] are [[hidden]] by themselves, so it is not subject to [[change]].
					- Asking about things openly in a way that may brings these [[rules]] out into the open is seen as an [[attack]].

					- There is a [[chance]] of changing things by leaders changing themselves, and examining and testing their own thinking aggressively and honestly.
					- If we assume the other is stupid or evil, then we do not have to put energy into getting whatever we want- we can say we can't do it.
