If lead [[scouts]] all think the same thing, then [[information]] is not properly integrated. For this reason, it is useful for a group to have scouts with a [[diversity]] of information. [[Indecision]] among scouts results in an indirect poll of potential followers- since followers will only blindly follow if there is [[unity]] among scouts. Information spreads best if individuals with high informational breadth are spread evenly through the group.
- What decides [[salience]] in your [[attention]]? What [[marks]] do you look for to find a [[trail]] worth following? How can you leave such marks for others?
- To be an [[expert]] is to have gone through something and come out of it alive.
- [[Murder]] is an attempt to resolve [[uncertainty]].
