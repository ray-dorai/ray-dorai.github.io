- Things to pay [[attention]] to when designing a way to learn how to know the [[thinking]] behind a particular [[skill]]:
	-
	  1.  What's it like to be someone who doesn't know this [[skill]]? What is this like for a five year old learning this skill for the first time? [[mentalizing]]
	-
	  2. How can this [[skill]] be taught one [[movement]] at a [[time]]?
	-
	  3. How much [[energy]] does it take to [[learn]]? What's the least amount of energy it takes for someone to learn what they need to know to know how to know what we know? How does the way a [[story]] moves change the way we learn?

	  4. How can we use what the learner already [[knows]] to help their [[learning]]? What does the learner know? How is this similar to what the learner needs to know to learn? What place are we using to show what the learner needs to know to learn? What can we avoid saying because it is already known? When something is partially similar, can we use what is the same to get to what isn't the same?
		- By showing how a learner already knows some of what is going to be learned, we lower [[resistance]] to [[learning]].
