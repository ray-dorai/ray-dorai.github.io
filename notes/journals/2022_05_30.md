- Any [[explanation]] that allows the [[observer]] to pay more [[attention]] will serve better than an explanation that results in the observer paying less attention.
- [[Stealth]] is mostly about [[time]]. Effective stealth in conflict often has to do with moving [[slower]] than expected or [[moving]] [[faster]] than expected, rather than [[concealing]] [[direction]].
- Give [[groups]] a way to [[win]] [[together]] every day. Every time a group wins together, it improves its ability to win the next [[conflict]].
