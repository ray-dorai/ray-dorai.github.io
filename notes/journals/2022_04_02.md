- [[Neediness]] comes from [[fixation]].
  collapsed:: true
	- Your [[enemy]] cannot [[reject]] you. If you are [[fixated]] on an [[object]] that your enemy can associate with, they can offer to feed you that object in return for putting what they [[want]] above what you want. Your [[loss aversion]] becomes their gain.
		- Since a [[decision]] is a cutting off of a possible [[future]], many decisions start with [[No]].
			- Offering a [[Yes]] early [[trap]]s your opponent into over[[reach]]ing from [[fix]]ating on their goal, to turn a [[want]] into something that feels like a [[need]].
			- [[Invite]] your opponent to say [[No]].
			- If you make it [[safe]] for them to say [[No]], they'll feel safer to hear [[No]].
		- There are always more [[prey]], if one costs too much [[energy]] to get, let it go.
		- If you attempt to [[rush]] someone to a [[judgement]], they will be scared into [[defensive]][[resistance]].
		- If you do not get what you [[need]], you cease [[moving]] and [[die]]. If you do not get what you [[want]], you [[change]] and [[live]].
		- Feed your enemy's feeling of [[stability]] in their [[image]].
		  collapsed:: true
			- Let opponents show you their [[strength]], for it shows you their [[weakness]].
			- Someone in the room needs to occupy [[bottom]] [[status]], let it be you.
		- If you [[save]] your [[enemy]], you are [[responsible]] for their [[decision]].
- There are >5200 [[Fremen]] out there. Paint a rallying point.
- Instead of [[yes]] and [[no]] questions, in [[negotiation]], consider 'what would you like me to do'? Or 'how can we do X'?
