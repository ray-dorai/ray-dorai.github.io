- [[Action]] comes before [[thought]]. The [[rules]] of the [[game]] come after the game has been played out, and [[people]] want to make sense of the game after the fact of [[play]].
- Both '[[people]]' and '[[folk]]' come from '[[army]]', the form of which comes from '[[fill]]'. Compare to '[[strategy]]' which comes from '[[spread]]'.
- [[Time]] comes from [[movement]] and what one can do with an [[environment]]. A familiarity with an environment or [[situation]] can, relative to another's [[perception]], slow down time.
