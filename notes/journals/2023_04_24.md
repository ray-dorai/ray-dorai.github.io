- [[Perception]] of [[time]] happens through sensing [[events]] that [[change]] what is [[possible]] to do with the [[environment]].
	- Something in the [[world]] is [[meaningful]] when it makes it possible to [[move]] in an extra way.
	- When new [[skills]] are [[learned]], they make new [[relationships]] with [[things]] in the [[world]] that allow for new ways to [[move]].
	- The [[group]] the [[individual]] is a part of, [[history]], and [[body]] all offer a set of [[affordances]].
	- [[Affordances]] need a window of [[time]], since nothing can be done with a snapshot of time.
	  collapsed:: true
		- There must be some [[future]] to [[play]] with, to see an affordance. An [[affordance]] shows what can be done within a [[time]] [[frame]].
	- [[Time]] changes the [[body]], so the body is a [[record]] of time.
	- [[Moving]] a hand to grab something [[changes]] the [[shape]] of the hand to [[fit]] the shape of the thing being grabbed. [[Intention]] shapes [[action]].
		- Without a [[record]] of what happened, it is not possible to [[relate]] what is happening with what happened. So no [[relation]] can be established to use to [[make]] [[sense]] of things.
- Check a [[purpose]] or [[value]] against what doesn't [[change]].
- Is this [[time]]less?
