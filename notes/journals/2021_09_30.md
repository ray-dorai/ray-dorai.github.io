- When someone misses an [[attack]] that has [[power]], it puts them off [[balance]]. How may you let someone miss?
- [[Muay]] [[kru]] Kem says you only need to go about 70% effort on strikes. 100% is enough power to generate a lot of [[tension]], and that tension will disrupt your [[balance]]. He suggests [[meditation]] after every training session to learn to improve your ability to [[predict]] your opponent. [[Sylvie Von Douglas-Ittu]] says you rush when you can't predict what is happening, which creates tension.
- [[Balance]] is a [[transport]] network for [[speed]] and [[power]].
- Use the [[strikes]] that you've landed as your [[feint]].
- Throwing [[strikes]] immediately left then right forces [[balance]]. You cannot do this if you're off balance.
- Keeping [[balance]] after you are attacked changes the [[narrative]] of how people perceive that [[attack]].
- To [[command]] is to bring inside. To be an [[empire]] is to bring [[inside]] and put in a [[line]].
- It should be possible to build [[robust]] models of [[culture]] from [[plant]] [[growth]] [[models]].
- Being [[demanding]] makes sense if you think the [[group]] is [[dying]]. If you believe in the group, you will attempt to [[give]] as much to the group as possible.
- The [[inverse]] [[problem]] of [[motor]] [[control]].
- To be in [[pain]] is to [[pay]], to be [[punish]]ed with a [[fine]] or a [[penalty]].
- When you [[create]] an [[object]] by [[naming]] it, drop it.
