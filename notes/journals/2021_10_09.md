- Short [[film]]: it follows the trajectory of [[Jackie Chan]] action scenes, where the hero starts at the bottom, but it's for cooking. Our hero is a programmer working remotely who has been completely isolated during COVID and is getting desperate for human contact. He has dinner planned with a friend he's also secretly interested in romantically but he's never cooked a meal in his life before. The movie follows him as he uses generalized learning heuristics to narrow down the skills he needs and successfully learns to cook a meal, and then learns to riff off of it.
