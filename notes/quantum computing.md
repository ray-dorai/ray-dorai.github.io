- [[Tiny]] things [[tunnel]] through stuff, but how?
- Quantum computers must be [[cold]] to maintain [[coherence]].
  collapsed:: true
	- What about the [[entanglements]] in [[cryptochromes]]?
- [[Perfect]] models of tiny things are possible. So we can [[check]] for [[proof]] of [[predictions]] about how [[materials]] will behave.
  collapsed:: true
	- Seeing how metals may bend before we make them.
	- How air might move around a plane before building it.
	- How food might taste.
	- How strong buildings might be.
- Instead of on/off [[switches]], these sending [[signals]] in a [[wave]] that [[spreads]].
	- This is what we need to make things [[cold]] and use [[lasers]] for- because it might get too chaotic to get any [[signal]] we can understand out of it.
