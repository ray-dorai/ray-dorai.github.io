	  It is everyone's [[responsibility]] to find a solution that isn't blocked by anyone in the group. Stop anyone from belittling anyone else's Block. The Block can happen for any reason or no reason. If anyone Blocks the decision, the decision must be dropped until another day.

- If you can introduce [[feedback]] from a [[crowd]], you can enable crowd [[emotional]] [[energy]] dynamics.
- High [[linguistic]] [[diversity]] is a mark of weak [[competition]] between groups. This is most common in thick [[forest]] and high [[mountains]], where geology allows groups to compete against the [[environment]] instead of each other.
- Self-organization relies on four factors:
	- Positive feedback loop from executing basic movement.
	- Negative feedback to counter positive feedback and stabilize [[collective]].,
	- Amplification of change by positive feedback. New structures come from [[randomness]], so new solutions come from [[randomness]].
	- Individuals need multiple, essentially [[redundant]], methods to move together.
