- Trust is a [[bet]] that the other will act as they are or as they appear to be.
  Action becomes easier with [[trust]].
- History teaches familiarity with the world, and [[familiarity]] allows for trust.
- When one thing is more important than all things, trust is [[fragile]].
- Whoever trusts must accept the risk of that trust.
  Trusting is made easier by using symbols of trust. These symbols are used to justify the risk of trusting.
- Defining [[reasons]] for trust may hurt trust, since reasons imply a trust in those reasons rather than the object of trust.
- Giving people reasons is an act of self-[[sacrifice]]. Since, if they have your reasons, they will not need you.
- The more reasons someone gives, the less they have to be trusted. Since, if you have the reasons, you have a means to accomplish the activity without the person that would be trusted.
- Trust brings the outside in.
- [[Systems]] within the world have fewer possibilities than the world, thus they are less [[complex]] than the world. This [[simplicity]] bestows [[subjectivity]], since there is more apparent order within the system than without.
- [[Trust]] is an operation of the will because it brings outside processes inside.
- Great trust requires a great will because trust brings the outside inside.
- Trust goes beyond [[information]], so requires the truster to have some in formation already.
- If you do not know how someone will act, you may base your trust in them on why you think they act.
- [[Law]] is often used in place of trust. Outside of simple legal systems, use of the law usually signifies a lack of trust.
- If a group trusts in the law more than each other, any breach of the law is cause for distrust of the individual.
  If a group trusts in each other more than the law, the law loses relevance.
  Trust only happens when the truster can be [[betrayed]] by the trusted- when the truster is [[dependent]] on the trusted in some way. This needs mutual commitment. It can only be tested if the truster goes first and the trusted goes second. The situation that tests trust must be [[common knowledge]].
- Trust cuts through [[time]].
  Trust assumes time.
  [[movement]] assumes time.
- A [[Constant]] is a feature of the [[present]].
- The more [[complex]] things get, the more you must [[synthesize]] and [[compress]].
- All cause is mutual [[cause]].
- [[Trust]] synthesizes and [[compresses]]. The more [[complexity]] you deal with, the more you must trust.
- [[Trust]] enables [[freedom]].
- A feature of [[systems]] is [[reduction]] through [[selection]].
- To display [[trust]] is to assume the future.
- [[Time]] in you is not the same as time out of you.
  '[[Objective]]' times is a shared [[creation]] between [[subjects]]- an agreement on duration and change.
- Duration and [[change]] are mutually exclusive, but it is in this [[paradox]] that we define time.
- [[Change]] presupposes a [[fixed]] point in [[time]].
- Constancy is a feature of the [[present]], and [[duration]] is a collection of constancies. Here, events come from [[expectation]]s and recollections made in the present.
- In the past time was [[Now]], now time was and will be at various points.
- Trust is secure only in the [[Now]].
- To persist, trust must be [[immune]] to the back-and-forth of [[suspicion]].
- Can you pursue instrumentality without sacrificing expressiveness?
- [[Trust]] shares an inverse relationship with [[communication]].
