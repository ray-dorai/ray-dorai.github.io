- [[Helicopter]] [[assaults]] are usually a [[costly]] [[signal]]. Anything approaching [[symmetry]] in [[force]] would make them a huge [[tactical]] [[liability]]. So they're more about [[policing]] than they are about [[fighting]] a [[war]] .
- "Bad [[weather]] is the best time to [[attack]] a [[target]] [on [[foot]]]".

- "From a HHQ perspective, the [[radio]] is a means to issue [[orders]] and provide [[direction]] to subordinates. For the men on the ground, the radio was our primary method of [[networking]] ideas and [[sharing]] [[information]]. As such it was our lifeline." [[decentralization]]

- "The [commanding General] had grossly over-estimated the omnipotence of [[technology]]. He failed to understand that the reality of the [[situation]] could only be understood and accessed through the collective omniscience of the guys on the [[ground]]." [[grunt]]
