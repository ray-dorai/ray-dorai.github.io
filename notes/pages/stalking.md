	  1. [[Slow]] yourself down.
	  2. Shorten [[stride]].
		- -fox walk- a quarter of normal speed. Half the stride. 
		  -land with outside edge of the foot softly, decide if you want to step where you're landing, when you decide 'yes', then finish your step.
		  -when your [[feet]] are feeling the ground in this way, this frees your eyes to look around
		  -a stalking [[step]] is about a minute per step
		  -due to this speed, you need to stalk to where the animal will be, not where it is now
		  -lower head in a semi-crouch to break silhouette for prey animals
		  -how high you lift your leg is dependent on what you're stepping across
		  -your [[feet]] are groundward antenna

	- First apply dry wood ash to dull the skin. Wet wood ash has [[lye]], which would give a chemical burn.
	- Mixing colors and pigments with rendered [[fat]] will ensure the camo stays on for long periods of time.
