- "In an earlier talk, he explained that he designed his [[games]] starting with how you physically interact with the [[controls]] you're holding in your hand, and then inwards into the computer, instead of the other way around like so many other people tend to do.  In a later talk, about the [[Wii]], he explained that now he designs his games starting with the facial [[expressions]] of the [[people]] playing them, then to the physical experience that could evoke such an expression, then on into the computer that could conduct such an experience. As an example, he showed a picture of a grandfather with his granddaughter sitting in his lap, playing a game, looking totally entranced and delighted at the game, and her grandfather looking at her, with just as entranced and delighted an expression as on his granddaughter's face, even if he didn't necessarily understand what the game itself was about. He got so much enjoyment out of just watching his granddaughter enjoying the game, that it was [[fun]] for him, too."
- Miyamoto and Nintendo do not use focus groups. He figures that if the [[game]] is fun for him it will be for many others. So make what you love.
