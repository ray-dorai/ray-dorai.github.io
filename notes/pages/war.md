To do that you have to destroy his weapons, but that is only incidental. You must read biography and especially [[autobiography]]. If you will do it you will find that war is [[simple]]. Decide what will hurt the [[enemy]] most within the limits of your capabilities to harm him and then do it. TAKE CALCULATED RISKS. That is quite different from being rash. " [[Patton]]
