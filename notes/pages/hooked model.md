- What daily [[routine]] or [[behavior]] can your [[product]] be linked to?
  First-to-mind solution: If a user feels bored, you want them to think of your product as an answer to their boredom.
   A question- Google
   Loneliness- TikTok, Tinder, Facebook, Instagram

  |Hook Model|
  Trigger: what sparks a reaction. A notification is an external trigger. A feeling of thirst is an internal trigger. By matching a notification to thirst, such as 'are you thirsty', you may attach your product notification to existing behavior. 
  Action: clicking or buying or doing something else that brings you to the potentially rewarding part of the product.
  [[Variable]] [[Reward]]: predictable rewards don't create desire. To use desire, the reward should occur sometimes but not all the time. The uncertainty creates focus, which like a nicotine high, is a prime time for inserting a new behavior.
  Investment: giving you the ability to invest attention (in the form of time, money, or other commitment) which tricks your mind into thinking it can impact the variable reward.
- How can we use this to help people make the [[choices]] they want to make?
- [[Hooks]] can be used to combine a problem with a firm's solution.
- Many [[decisions]] are made out of [[habit]], simply because a similar action provided relief in the past.
- If using your product is a habit, the customer will use your product everyday without needing calls-to-action, ads, etc.
- Nobody knows what a [[business]] is worth because a business is worth what it's future [[profit]] is worth and no one knows the future.
- Customer lifetime value ([[CLTV]]). The higher the CLTV,  the more firms will invest in acquiring customers.
- Creating a habit and then asking for [[money]] is how a lot of free-to-play games work.
- If your customers continuously find what they want in your product, they will tell others about it.
- What is the amount of [[time]] it takes someone to invite someone else to use your product?
- You must be [[10x]] better to outcompete old habits.
- People store what they want in habit-forming products. Consider the messages saved in your Gmail, WhatsApp, etc.
- [[Behaviors]] are Last in, first out.
- For new behaviors to turn into habits, they must happen often.
- For an uncommon behavior to become a habit, it must have a high chance of pleasure or avoiding pain.
- Both Progressive and Amazon help customers compare prices with their competitors, which cements their place as a provider of information in their customer's minds.
- How often does the behavior occur? How much more rewarding is the behavior compared to competing impulses?
- What [[product]] is neither a vitamin or a painkiller, but something like steroids or psychedelics?
- A [[habit]] is when not doing the habit causes some [[pain]].
- What habits does our [[business]] model need to succeed?
- How do people currently solve your business problem, and why do they need your solution?
- How often do you expect people to use your product?
- What behavior do you want to turn into a habit?
- Internal [[triggers]] like [[fear]], [[boredom]], [[loneliness]], or [[frustration]] are particularly sticky as triggers for habits, since people will try to distract themselves from any 'negative' feeling.
- If they have a [[habit]], what are they feeling right before they execute on a habit?
- What would someone get from using your [[solution]] to what they're feeling?
  Where will they use it? When will they use it?
- What [[pain]] do you seek to address? How will you associate that pain with your solution?
- You must be able to write a [[user]] [[narrative]] that reflects your best [[synthesis]] of what everyone's feeling. In that narrative is a sequence of feelings, and in that sequence is one the feelings that you can match to your solution. Remember Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo's design method.
- What do they [[want]]? What are they [[afraid]] of? What is the context in which they will use your solution?
- For any daily sequence of [[behaviors]], ask 'why' until you get to an [[emotion]].
- When the user <internal trigger>, they <first action in habit>. What might the best time and place to establish an external trigger that will be associated (over time) with an internal trigger?
- To act, the user must want to act, have the ability to act, and the trigger to act must be present.
- B = MAT
  behavior = motivation, ability, trigger
- Motivation: the [[energy]] for [[action]].
- Lay out steps to get what the customer wants done. See if you can simplify this process.
- Take an ancient [[Want]], then make it simpler to get that want.
- Six elements of simplicity:
  how much [[time]] it costs
  how much [[money]] it costs
  how much physical labor it costs
  how much [[attention]] it costs
  how much [[shame]] it costs
  how new/unusual is it
- What is blocking consumers from consuming your [[product]]?
- Increasing motivation is very hard for companies, so they typically increase ability to perform their preferred action by making the action cost less in time, money, attention, shame, etc.
- The appearance of [[scarcity]] affects the perception of [[value]]. Recall when Airbnb pretended like it was going to run out of bnbs in Portland and Grace wanted to make a decision about where to go more quickly.
- A [[product]] may be perceived to be less valuable if it is at first scarce then suddenly abundant.
- One of the world's most prestigious violinists performed in a DC subway, where he appears to have been regarded as just another busker. Meanwhile, when performing at Carnegie Hall, he sells it out.
- People increase in motivation as they feel they are reaching a [[goal]]. For this reason, giving people a punch card with two "free" holes already punched works better than a punch card with no "free" holes punched, even if the absolute number of holes is the same.
- Go through the path your [[users]] would have to take to use your service or product. How many steps does it take? Can you simplify it? Is what is costing too much time, money, labor, attention, or unfamiliarity? What are three testable ways you can make the action easier for your users? How might you use biases to make your product a habit?
- All [[businesses]] are about giving people what they think they [[want]].
- People must develop a [[dependence]] on your [[product]] as the [[solution]] to what they think they [[want]].
- What often reels people in is not the sensation of the [[reward]] itself, but the [[craving]] to satiate the need for reward.
  Once people think they know a thing, they grow bored of it, wanting variation- wanting the environment.
- Your [[product]] must be [[surprising]] in a safe way. Variable reward (like a slot machine) is a method companies typically use to create this sensation.
- Skinnerbox: a pet food dispenser with variable reward.
- Some [[variable]] rewards are [[validation]]-based, as in the reward of perceiving inclusion in a tribe.
- When people see people they perceive are like themselves validated for a behavior, they are more likely to engage in that behavior.
- Persistence [[hunting]] is relevant because people pursue goals with single-minded persistence. Where we once hunted animals, we now hunt money or information.
- [[Completionist]] tendencies can be leveraged to have your users form a habit of using your product or service to complete a collection.
- A sense of [[competition]] and ability to gain and [[display]] competence is another variable reward. A feeling of [[mastery]] is the sensation attached to this reward.
- "Rewards must fit into the narrative of why the product is used and align with the user's internal triggers and motivations."
- When a stranger asked people for bus fare, adding "but you are free to accept or refuse" increased the amount of money he received drastically. 
  -Give your users a sense of [[agency]].
  --it must be their idea.
- [[Reactance]] is what happens when we perceive a threat to our [[autonomy]]. Account to reactance.
- Is your service or product enjoyable? Does it give people a new way to fill an existing need?
- Is it Alive? If it lacks [[Aliveness]], users will become [[bored]].
- Three types of variable reward are validation, hunting, and autonomy/mastery.
- Speak with 5 of your customers to find out what they enjoy about your product. What are they delighted by? (Ask about their experience using the product open-endedly, do not prompt them about delight)
  What are they surprised by? 
  Is there anything they find particularly satisfying?
- What steps does your customer take to use the product or service habitually? What outcome alleviates the user's pain?
- What are three ways your product might variably reward its users with social validation, a hunt, or a sense of mastery?
- The more time, effort, and attention people put into something, the more they want it. Remember the IKEA effect.
- Appeal to a person's sense of consistency. If you got them to commit to something, it will be easier to get them to do it. Ask for something small, then follow up with a bigger ask that is consistent with the agreement they made to do the small thing.
- "To avoid the cognitive dissonance of not liking something in which others seem to take so much pleasure, we slowly change our perception of the thing we once did not enjoy."
- The more we work on something, the more we want it.
- If we agreed to do something before, we are more likely to do something similar again.
- Ask your users for work only after they have received variable reward. This is so you can use their desire to reciprocate.
- Products and services occupy the same space for people as people. This is why your product can use reciprocity to sell.
- What kind of work are your users doing that will prompt them to return to using your product?
- How can you have your users store a reputation, data, badges, skill, or a community in your product?

  4. [Variable Reward]
  Are you users satisfied with your reward, yet left wanting more?
  5. [Investment]
  What work are your users investing in your solution?
- Would you use your own product?
