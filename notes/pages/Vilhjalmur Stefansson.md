- Living among the [[Eskimo]] ([[Inuit]]) revealed a lot of [[information]] about [[survival]] and human [[behavior]].
- "On one occasion, when I had strongly in mind the [[scientific]] [[value]] and the [[food]] value of a grizzly [[bear]], I discovered a grizzly sitting on the slope on the side of his den...I was [[surprised]] to find the bear awake so late in the season...One sees things under circumstances that give one no idea of the [[distance]]. The [[marmot]] at twenty yards occupies as large a visual angle as a grizzly bear at several hundred. And if you suppose the marmot to be several hundred yards away, you naturally take him for a bear."
- "Their [[food]] [[prejudices]] are very much like those of men...the son of [[wealthy]] parents who is used to eating 50 different articles of food in a week will take quickly to the 51st, but a farmer's son will not eat anything [[new]]...our house [[dogs]], which are used to eating all the varied things that we [[eat]], are used to so many flavors that they take easily to one more that happens to be strange. The white man's dog that comes to the Arctic is likely to eat seal meat, or any other meat of local growth the first time it is offered to him. But take an Indian's dog that has been brought up inland on nothing but caribou meat and bring him to the coast- he will [[starve]] for a week before he is willing to swallow the first mouthful of seal."[[resistance]] [[change]] [[scarcity]] [[novelty]]
