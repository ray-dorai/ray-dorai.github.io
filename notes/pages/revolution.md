	- 1. [[Fiscal]] illiquidity, [[officials]] and [[enforcers]] are not paid.
	  2. Intra-[[elite]] conflict between [[state]] officials and those who [[finance]] the state- [[economic]] elite vs [[ruling]] [[officials]].
	  3. [[Mass]] [[movement]] of dissidents- a movement claims a [[solution]] to the [[deadlock]] and fills the vacuum. The solution doesn't have to be real- it is often [[ideology]] used as a unifying [[tactic]]. The revolutionaries have to be able to [[attack]] the deadlock and make the State [[solvent]] again.
