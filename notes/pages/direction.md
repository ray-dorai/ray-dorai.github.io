- 500,000 years.
	- Multi-galactic [[life]] from [[Earth]].
	- 1000 years.
		- Interplanetary [[life]] from [[Earth]].
		- 30 years.
			- Establish a social system to unite 500,000 [[competent]] sentiences toward the [[expansion]] of [[life]] from Earth. This includes practices, [[rites]], and ways to decide that aim for [[adaptation]] to increasingly hostile [[environments]].
				- This is because life on Earth will need better ways to coordinate to successfully [[seed]] the [[galaxy]].
			- At least ten genetic or mimetic grandchildren.
				- I want to expand. This is the best-tested method of expansion.
			- Social environment is prepared for someone who a billion can call on and find an answer. A home is being made for a multi-faceted, highly [[mobile]], swarmlike [[hunting]] [[culture]].
			- 10 years.
				- At least fifty thousand [[people]] with critical [[wants]] being met through my actions.
				- Live [[Action]] Battle [[Arena]] is a fully-running [[sport]].
				  collapsed:: true
					- This is to [[seed]] an [[adaptable]] and [[mobile]] [[hunting]] [[mindset]] in the population.
				- Release a [[text]] to aid in the [[expansion]] of [[life]] by synthesizing every universalizing [[world]] myth into a fractally-adaptable unifying [[story]].
				  collapsed:: true
					- This is to help trigger the unification of a new social system strong enough to devour competing universalizing systems.
				- [[Land]] is enough to feed 50 people with as much effort and [[energy]] use as a small-scale society might use.
				  collapsed:: true
					- This is to develop an intuition about what it takes to live.
				- 5 years.
					- Combat playground running.
						- This is to prepare for the Live [[Action]] Battle [[Arena]].
					- Able to [[lift]] double bodyweight for most compound lifts.
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Strength]] will help for fighting bigger opponents. Fighting bigger opponents will aid in capturing mental real estate, due to the salience from drama. Further, in North American culture, people prefer to support those they perceive as underdogs.
					- At least 3 amateur fights.
					  collapsed:: true
						- Need the experience to appeal to fighters and help launch the Live Action Battle Arena.
					- [[Land]] in an inconvenient environment to improve.
						- Many methods like intercropping and using local, edible plants are not open if depending on the current ag system or working for someone else. So, we will need our own land to [[experiment]]. Socially, most places are hostile to improvement.
						- An environment that is inconvenient aids in [[alignment]] of the people in that environment.
							- Harsh [[places]] act as repellent for [[mask]]-fixations.
								- Mask-fixations are the most common failure-mode for [[alignment]] in groups today.
					- [[Fiction]] that is generating at least $2000 (adjusted for today's dollar) in [[sales]]/year.
					  collapsed:: true
						- Mastering appealing fiction will make it easier to write a unifying text later.
					- Community mindshare somewhere in [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Somalia]], or [[Nigeria]].
					  collapsed:: true
						- Elites and counter-elites give most of their attention to Western states. China, as the up-and-coming global power, will be important to have nodes in. Brazil, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria are up-and-coming cultural centers. Russia and Somalia experience pressures to adapt to conflict with lower resources, so people there will be extremely useful to learn from.
					- Most of the [[meat]] in my [[diet]] from [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].
					  collapsed:: true
						- Besides cost, it will train the [[hunting]] mindset and help examine the relationship with living off the [[land]].
