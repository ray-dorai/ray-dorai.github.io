A list of books, films, shows, and games that I have taken in that I anctipate you, the reader, are unlikely to hear recommended elsewhere. If you find something here that you've heard recommended elsewhere (without going out looking for it specifically), do let me know. <p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worm_Ouroboros">The Worm Ouroboros</a>: there are Demons and Witches, but no one is demonized- written in the early 20th century, <i>The Worm Ouroboros</i> captures the feel of an epic medieval saga where the fate of lands are tied up in the martial actions of their warriors and kings. The people in this story are happy to meet their fate, as bloody as it is, as bloody as they are.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw_Down_(film)">Throw Down (2004)</a>: a movie that packs many of the beats of 90s Hong Kong cops-and-prostitutes cinema, but as applied to people connected through a love of the sport of Judo. The conflicts are played out in a combination of low-key heist, chases associated with petty crime, and, of course, judo throws, but it's really about people coming together to make marks on the world they live in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeelen">Yeelen (1987)</a>: a spiteful sorceror hunts his child, who may one day supplant him. The timelessness of this story is arresting. Apparently based on a legend of the founding one of the peoples of Mali.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushpizin">Ushpizin (2004)</a>: an older, childless Hasidic Jewish couple in Jerusalem run into financial trouble, get a particularly expensive Citron fruit anyway, and some unexpected guests.</p>
