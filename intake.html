A list of books, films, shows, and games that I've been enjoying lately.<p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_the_Condor_Heroes_(2017_TV_series)">The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2017)</a>: Two episodes in, and it's solidly executed Wuxia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11464059">Ultimate Speed Secrets: The Complete Guide to High-Performance and Race Driving by Ross Bentley</a>: In most months, driving is the most dangerous thing I do. Despite putting down hundreds of thousands of miles in a variety of vehicles, road conditions, and rules, I never thought to see what I could learn from professional road racers. So far, this book is immediately helpful by emphasizing the importance of seat fit (if you're not comfortable, you won't drive well) and smoothness of motion (jerky motions disrupt the tensegrity of the vehicle, which make it harder to control). While these are 'common sense', it's always gratifying to pay more attention to fundamentals in any skill.</p>
<p><a href="https://barabasi.com/book/the-formula">The Formula by Albert László-Barabási</a>: This is one of those books that I've wished for and was astounded to discover existed. Better known in our circle for his contributions to network science, the author goes through the unchanging patterns of success, which highlights the importance of many weak ties, the Matthew effect, and power laws.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60051983">Lords of the Deccan by Anirudh Kanisetti</a>: Histories of South India are scarce (in comparison to, say, Northwestern India), and this one provides a glimpse at that history by focusing on the family dramas that occurred in the dynasties of Southern India.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1521580/Perfect_Heist_2/">Perfect Heist 2</a>: A blocky cartoon multiplayer PvP first-person heist game. It's got a lot of classes that are probably balanced for 8 player games- I got it because it plays smoothly on Linux and features a class (The Detective) that uses tracking as a gameplay feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PK_(film)">PK (2014)</a>: I was introduced to Amir Khan's acting in <i>Laal Singh Chaddha</i>, and appreciated enough to check this out. He brought a similar, absurdist performance, though the movie itself is a sort of feel-good 'why can't people be peaceful' comedy. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thewayofarchery.com/index.html">The Way of Archery: A 1637 Chinese Military Manual</a>: An economist and a computer scientist rediscovering Chinese archery techniques translated this. It's always fun to go through old manuals, and see how they work for learning skills today. So far, there is recognition of patterns that apply much more broadly than archery, which I understand is a purpose to the manual that the authors acknowledge. </p>
