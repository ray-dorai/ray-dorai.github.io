	<p>Things vaguely like poetry, longform notes, and some verbal explorations. Unfinished notes can be found at <a href="https://anagora.org/@forshaper">An Agora</a>, a multiplayer gathering of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">digital slipboxes</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/explorations">Read on...</a></p>
	<p>I also offer the service of making decisions for people, given the pain involved in making decisions. This costs US$250/decision for every decision after the first decision, which is free. Discounts for Eth, xDai, Solana, and USDC. I will take blame for all the results of this decision, and none of the praise. If you like the results of the decision, I will be happy to keep it a secret. If you don't like the results of the decision, I will be happy to own that decision publicly. E-mail me at ray[dot]doraisamy[at]gmail[dot]com if you would like me to make a decision.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, for the equivalent of US$500 per point of blame, I will take the blame for any decision. This includes an ongoing explanation of how I am to blame for this decision. </p>

	<h1>Current Projects:</h1>
		<p><a href="/tpotcouchsurfing.html">TPOT Couch Surfing</a>, a map of space available from This Part of Twitter.</p>
	        <p><a href="https://www.agitproper.org/">Agitproper</a>, propaganda strategization for anyone.</p>
	        <p><a href="https://foretrek.com/">Foretrek</a>, uniting teams.</p>
		<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/walkswithray">Walks with Ray</a>, a podcast showcasing how thoughts arise from walking.</p>
	         A <b>Submission Grappling</b> class at the local recreation center to test a curriculum using the ecological approach.
	<h1>Shelved Projects:</h1>
	        <p><a href="https://ray-dorai.github.io/armyourmind/">Arm Your Mind</a>, combat tactics for people with little interest in combat tactics. I started this in response to the panic of 2020, it does not seem to have much of a need now. Though, I may go back and start filling things in later.</p>
		<p><b>Circle of Kings</b>, a low fantasy fiction inspired by Southern India and South-East Asia. Needs a lot more research then I can currently muster. I also hatched this when I was in India, and without interacting with at least one Indian every day, it's hard to stay in this mindset. </p>
	        <p><b>Nth Culture Kid</b>, an autobiography. I expect this to flow out if we're expecting a child. Otherwise, it does not seem to have a reason to come out.</p>
                <p><b>Abode of the Yielding Way</b>, a combat playground and civilizational seed. Needs building blocks. Which means a minimum viable Live-Action Battle Arena and some land.</p>
	<h1>Dropped Projects:</h1>
	        <p><b><a href="https://hitw.neocities.org/">Hollow is The World</a></b>, a stabby hard fantasy serial featuring <a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a> to memorize a little of what the characters learn. It was perhaps overly self-indulgent.
	        <p><a href="https://raydoraisamy.bandcamp.com/album/if-you-ask-its-free">If you ask, it's free</a>, an album. It was an experiment, now learned from and done.</p>
                <p><b>The Niobrara Project</b>: 'Deep Springs College on the frontier for adults' is still something of a dream, but perhaps we'll end up with less of a college and more of the civilizational seed, at a smaller scale.
	<h1>Upcoming Projects:</h1>
	       <p><b>Life Kills: A Southeast Asian Perspective</b>. An audio series looking at fights to see how people learn to live together. This will be a polished, edited podcast to contrast against 'Walks with Ray'. 

	
	<p>I am generally available for video chat or meatspace meetups (allowing for notice in advance), given the vagaries of time and space.</p>
