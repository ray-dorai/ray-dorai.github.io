 <p>
Things are changing quickly. Those who change will win, and those who don't will lose. I am here to help spread life as far as it can go. To do that, <i>I'm looking for ways of living that will help people stay moving</i>.  A lot of these ways are shown in hunting mindsets. Many ways are hidden in ways we've ignored, or ones long dead. Looking at all the ways life has moved will give us a new way to move. 
<p> I want to start Live-Action Battle Arenas as a sport. A way for people to grow their ability to fight and move together. One that can be scaled from kids with nerf guns and boffer sticks in a neighborhood to adults with chalk rounds in real rifles and blunt swords in a stadium.
